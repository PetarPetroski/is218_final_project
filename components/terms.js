                <p>Welcome to PlainShirts, where simplicity meets style! Before you embark on your journey to discover the world of plain T-shirts, please take a moment to read our not-so-legal, but kinda important, Terms and Conditions.</p>

                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">1. The Plain Basics</h2>
                <p>1.1 <strong>T-shirt Love:</strong> By using PlainShirts, you agree to share our deep affection for plain T-shirts. We&apos;re talking about shirts so plain, they make vanilla ice cream look rebellious.</p>
                <p>1.2 <strong>Color Freedom:</strong> We believe in the freedom to choose your shirt color. We have so many colors, it&apos;s like a crayon box exploded in our warehouse. We won&apos;t judge if you pick neon pink. Okay, maybe a little.</p>

                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">2. Shipping Shenanigans</h2>
                <p>2.1 <strong>Snail Mail Express:</strong> Our standard shipping is as fast as a turtle in meditation. If you need it yesterday, you might want to consider inventing time travel or upgrading to our express shipping.</p>
                <p>2.2 <strong>Lost in Transit Adventure:</strong> If your package takes an unexpected detour to Bermuda, don&apos;t worry. We&apos;ll send out a search party, complete with pirate hats and treasure maps.</p>

                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">3. Returns and Refunds</h2>
                <p>3.1 <strong>Shirt Remorse:</strong> Changed your mind about that lime green shirt? No problem. Return it within 14 days, and we&apos;ll give you a refund. Just promise us you didn&apos;t spill mustard on it.</p>
                <p>3.2 <strong>Warp Zone Returns:</strong> If you discover a portal to another dimension in your T-shirt, please contact customer service immediately. We might have to borrow your discovery for a weekend getaway.</p>

                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">4. Shirt Superpowers</h2>
                <p>4.1 <strong>Invisibility Cloak Not Included:</strong> Despite our best efforts, our shirts won&apos;t make you invisible. If you manage to achieve invisibility using our shirts, please let us know your secret.</p>
                <p>4.2 <strong>Super Softness Guarantee:</strong> Our shirts are so soft, they&apos;ve been mistaken for clouds. If you don&apos;t agree, you might be a robot. In that case, we don&apos;t sell shirts for robots.</p>

                <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">5. Code of Conduct</h2>
                <p>5.1 <strong>Fashion Police Alert:</strong> Wearing our T-shirts is not a crime. However, pairing them with plaid pants might be. Use your newfound fashion power responsibly.</p>
                <p>5.2 <strong>Sharing is Caring:</strong> Feel free to share your PlainShirts love on social media. Tag us @PlainShirts and use #PlainAndProud. We might even send you a virtual high-five emoji.</p>

                <p>By continuing to use PlainShirts, you acknowledge that you&apos;ve read our Terms and Conditions and agree to embark on this plain adventure with us. If you have any questions, our customer service team is standing by with non-serious responses and a lot of enthusiasm.</p>

                <p>Happy Plain Shopping!</p>
